# C++ Transport Catalogue

## Description

The C++ Transport Catalogue is a comprehensive system designed to manage and process data related to transportation, such as buses and stops. The project serves as a practical application of various C++ concepts and libraries, with a particular focus on handling JSON data, and map rendering. 

The project was created to address the complexity of managing a dynamic and extensive transportation system. It offers a streamlined approach to handle various aspects of the system including updating stop information, bus routes, and stop distances. The functionality is wrapped in a simple and intuitive C++ interface, making it easy to integrate into larger systems.

## System Requirements

- C++17 or higher
- Compiler with support for C++17 (GCC, Clang, MSVC, etc.)
- Standard C++ Libraries

## Deployment Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/I-Kozhin/cpp-transport-catalogue.git`.
2. Navigate to the project directory with `cd cpp-transport-catalogue`.
3. Compile the project with your C++ compiler (e.g., `g++ -std=c++17 main.cpp -o transport_catalogue`).
4. Run the compiled executable (`./transport_catalogue`).

## Future Enhancements

While the project is currently in a usable state, there are several enhancements planned for the future to increase its capabilities:

- Implementation of a RequestHandler class to handle various types of requests and responses.
- Enhancements to the MapRenderer class to render maps based on a string.
- Further optimization of the input and output methods for more efficient data handling.
